In particular, decodeFloat 0 = (0,0). If the type contains a negative zero, also decodeFloat (-0.0) = (0,0). The result of decodeFloat x is unspecified if either of isNaN x or isInfinite x is True.

If x is a finite floating-point number, it is equal in value to significand x * b ^^ exponent x, where b is the floating-point radix. The behaviour is unspecified on infinite or NaN values.
